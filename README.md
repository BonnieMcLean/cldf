# Cross-linguistic Data Formats

To allow exchange of cross-linguistic data and decouple development of tools and methods from that of databases, standardized data formats are necessary.

The main types of cross-linguistic data we are concerned with here are wordlists and structure datasets which are used in historical linguistics.


## Design goals

- Data should be both editable "by hand" and amenable to reading and writing by software.
- UTF-8 encoded text files.
