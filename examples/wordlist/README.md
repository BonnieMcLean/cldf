# Word Lists in CLDF

In this example, I want to show how CSV with Metadata can be used to 
parse the most important datastructures which are currently handled in wordlists in LingPy and EDICTOR.
The example data for this can be found in `forms.csv` and `cognates.csv`, while the metadata file is `Wordlist-metadata.json`. 
  
Running the file `test_data.py`, you will see that the file currently contains a number of errors, including bad partial alignments.
