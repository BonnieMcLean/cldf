# Word Lists in CLDF

In this example, I want to show how CSV with Metadata can be used to 
parse the most important datastructures which are currently handled in wordlists in LingPy and EDICTOR.
The example datasets I will use for this is the file `example.tsv`, and the metadata file is `example.tsv-metadata.json`. 
  
Running the file `test_data.py`, you will see that the file currently contains a number of errors, including bad partial alignments.

TODO: Show
- csvsort: sorting cognates by Cognate_set_ID,
- csvcut: then show alignments
