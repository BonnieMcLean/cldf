### Multi-dimensional features

Multi-dimensional features are useful to model data like paradigms. To support multi-dimensional features, we specify a standard separator for feature ID components: `~`. I.e. a local feature ID for a multi-dimensional feature can be coded as
```
Language_ID Feature_ID Value
deu         Sg~1P     ich
deu         Pl~1P     wir
```
