## Cognates

A major use case of wordlists in historical linguistics is as basis for the assembling of
cognate sets. Assigning forms to cognate sets is itself a (rather large) step
in analyzing the wordlist data, but also serves as intermediate step before
feeding the cognate sets into further analyses e.g. to determine language relatedness.

Thus, being able to exchange data on cognate judgements related to wordlists
is important, and therefore covered by CLDF. The default description of the cognate
table is available in [`CognateTable-metadata.json`](CognateTable-metadata.json).

It is recommended to add columns or other metadata describing the method used
for the cognacy judgements and the alignments, but no clear standard for these
has evolved yet.
