## Cognate sets

In historical linguistics cognate judgements have often been postulated "en gros",
i.e. as complete set, not based on justifications for invidual cognates. Thus, the
requirement arises to encode data related to cognate sets.

The default description of the cognateset table is available in 
[`CognatesetTable-metadata.json`](CognatesetTable-metadata.json).
