# CognateSet

## Description

A cognate set groups a number of words from different or the same language which are supposed to be historically related. Cognate sets in this definition explicitly include instances of borrowing, in which case users may want to specifically annotate that a given word form has been borrowed from a certain language. Cognate sets in this notion are best compared to homologs in biology. ([List 2016](:ref:List2016f).
