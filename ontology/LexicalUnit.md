# LexicalUnit

## Description

A lexical unit is any collection of word forms corresponding to a certain meaning which can be found in comparative datasets. Ideally, a lexical unit would just present itself as one single [form](:gold:FormUnit). However, in practice, scholars often list speech variants and at times even non-cognate alternatives for their preferred form.
