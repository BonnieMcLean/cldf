# SoundSequence

## Description

A sound sequence is understood as the strict segmental representation of a [form unit](:gold:FormUnit) of a language, which is usually given in phonetic transcription. [Suprasegmental elements](:gold:Suprasegmental), like tone or accent, of sound sequences are usually represented in a sequential form, although they are usually co-articulated along with the segmental elements of a sound sequence. Alternatively, suprasegmental aspects could also be represented as part of the [prosodic structure](:cldf:ProsodicStructure) of a word form.
