# ProsodicStructure

## Description

The prosodic structure of a [word form](:cldf:Segments) labels similar prosidic contexts which may recur even withing the same word. Prosodic structures for a given language may have an underlying template that describes which syllables are possible. In Chinese dialects, for example, one could describe the basic template of most syllables as consisting of *initial*, *medial*, *nucleus*, *coda*, and *tone*, of which the nucleus and the tone as a suprasegmental element are usually the only required elements.
