# SubSequence (Morpheme??)

## Description

[Word forms](:cldf:SoundSequence) can often be subdivided into smaller functional units (usually corresponding to a [morpheme](:gold:Morpheme)). A subsequence of a sound sequence, however, does not necessarily need to represent a true morpheme, but rather a unit that is determined by scholars to serve as the basis for historical comparison.
