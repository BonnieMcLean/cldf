# MotivationStructure

## Description

The motivation structure of a word form gives glosses for each of its [morphemes](:gold:Morpheme). In this it is similar to an instance of [inter-linear-glossed text](:ref:?) which describes the underlying semantic motivation for a given word form.
As an example, consider Chinese *shùpí* "bark (of a tree)" which is a compound consisting of *shù* "tree" and *pí* "skin", and whose motivation structure could be rendered as `tree bark`.
