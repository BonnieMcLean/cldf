# ConceptSet

## Definition

A concept set groups a number of concept labels which are used in different questionnaires and were judged to denote the same concept despite potential differences among the concrete concept labels (be it their spelling, or the language in which they were originally created) ([List et al. 2016](:ref:List2016a)).
